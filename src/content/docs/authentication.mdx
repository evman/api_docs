title: Authentication
description: How to authenticate with the Wallet API
---

All API requests require authentication using an API key in the `X-API-Key` header.

## API Keys

API keys are at least 32 characters and should be generated securely:

```bash
# Generate a secure API key
openssl rand -hex 32
```

---

## Request Format

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/wallets \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk_live_abc123..."
```

---

## Example Request

```python
import requests

headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "sk_live_abc123...",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/wallets",
    headers=headers
)
```

## Security Best Practices

:::caution
Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories.
:::

- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use strong, randomly generated keys (32+ characters)
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use separate keys for different environments
