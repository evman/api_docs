title: Addresses Overview
description: Generate and manage deposit addresses
---

Addresses are unique deposit destinations derived from the HD wallet. They remain static forever.

## Key Concepts

- **Static addresses** - Addresses never change or expire
- **Optional reference_id** - Attach a UUID to correlate with your system
- **Idempotent creation** - Same reference_id + chain always returns the same address
- **No customer data** - API stores no customer information

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/addresses` | Create address (optionally with reference_id) |
| GET | `/addresses/{id}` | Get address by UUID |
| GET | `/addresses` | List addresses with filters |
| GET | `/addresses/by-reference/{reference_id}` | Get all addresses for a reference_id |
| GET | `/addresses/by-reference/{reference_id}/{chain}` | Get address for reference_id + chain |
| GET | `/addresses/by-address/{blockchain_address}` | Get by blockchain address |

## How It Works

```
Your App                              Wallet API
   │                                      │
   │  POST /addresses                     │
   │  {"chain": "eth",                    │
   │   "reference_id": "..."}             │
   │  ──────────────────────────────────▶ │
   │                                      │
   │                                      │  Derive address from
   │                                      │  HD wallet + next index
   │                                      │
   │  {"address": "0xABC...",             │
   │   "id": "f47ac10b-..."}              │
   │  ◀────────────────────────────────── │
   │                                      │
   │  Show address to user                │
   │  (same address every time            │
   │   for same reference_id)             │
   │                                      │
