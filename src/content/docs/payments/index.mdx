title: Payments Overview
description: Track cryptocurrency deposits and confirmations
---

Payments represent incoming cryptocurrency transactions detected on monitored addresses.

## Key Concepts

- **Automatic detection** - Polling service monitors all addresses
- **Confirmation tracking** - Payments progress through confirmation states
- **Webhook notifications** - Real-time alerts when payments are detected/confirmed
- **Historical data** - Full transaction history for each address
