## Notes

:::caution
The HD seed is generated server-side and stored encrypted. It is never exposed via the API. Ensure you have a secure backup process.
:::

- Only one wallet per chain per account
- Creating a wallet for an existing chain returns an error
- Wallets cannot be deleted (addresses may have received funds)
