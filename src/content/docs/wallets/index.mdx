title: Wallets Overview
description: Manage HD wallets for cryptocurrency payment processing
---

Wallets are HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallets that generate unique deposit addresses for each chain.

## Key Concepts

- **One wallet per chain** - Each blockchain has its own HD wallet
- **Unlimited addresses** - Generate as many addresses as needed from a single seed
- **Secure storage** - Seeds are encrypted and never exposed via API
- **Automatic backup** - Single seed backup recovers all addresses

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/wallets` | Create a new wallet |
| GET | `/wallets` | List all wallets |
| GET | `/wallets/{chain}` | Get wallet details |

## Wallet Lifecycle

```
1. Create Wallet (once per chain)
   └── Generates HD seed, stores encrypted

2. Generate Addresses
   └── Each address derived from seed + index

3. Monitor Payments
   └── Polling detects incoming transactions

4. Backup (manual, secure)
   └── Export seed phrase for disaster recovery
```
